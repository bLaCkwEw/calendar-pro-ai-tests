description: Move a deprecated public XWiki API out of a main module into its backward-compatibility
  `-legacy` module, so the main artifact drops the dead API while the legacy artifact re-adds it for
  existing extensions. Use when asked to remove/retire a deprecated class, interface, method or field,
  to "move an API to legacy", to clean up a module's deprecated surface, or whenever you deprecate an
  API and want the old one gone from the main jar. Covers migrating in-repo callers to the
  replacement, removing the API, re-adding it via a plain legacy class or an AspectJ aspect, the
  Revapi ignore, the coverage/pom fallout, and banning the main artifact in the WAR legacy
  dependencies. For the build/verify commands use xwiki-build; for the
  `@since`/`@Deprecated(since)` version string use xwiki-knowledge; for the PR use xwiki-pull-request.

# Moving a deprecated API to a `-legacy` module

XWiki keeps binary/semantic backward compatibility (enforced by Revapi — see the
`backward-compatibility` OKF topic). A deprecated **public** API therefore cannot simply be deleted:
it is **removed from the main module** and **re-added by that module's `-legacy` companion**, which
weaves the main artifact with AspectJ and re-exports it under the same
`xwiki.extension.features`. Existing extensions that still call the old API keep working by depending
on the legacy jar; the main jar is clean.

Do this only for a **public** API that has a **replacement** and is **not used** (or only lightly
used, migratable) inside `xwiki-commons`, `xwiki-rendering` and `xwiki-platform`. Purely `internal`
classes are not API — just delete them (with a Revapi ignore if flagged), no legacy needed.

## 1. Scope it and migrate callers first

1. Confirm the API is deprecated and has a documented replacement (`@deprecated … use {@link …}`).
2. Find every caller across the three repos (they are released together), e.g.
   `grep -rn "getFied(" xwiki-commons xwiki-rendering xwiki-platform --include=*.java | grep -v /target/`.
   The safest candidates have **zero production callers**.
3. **Migrate all in-repo callers to the replacement** and commit that mentally as step one — the main
   module and every consumer must compile without the deprecated API before you remove it.

## 2. Remove the API from the main module

Delete the declaration (and, for an interface method, its implementations). Keep the replacement.
Fix any `@see`/`{@link}` references that pointed at the removed member.

## 3. Re-add it in the `-legacy` module

Pick the pattern by API shape. Study the sibling that already does it (`xwiki-commons-legacy-job`
for whole types, `xwiki-commons-legacy-velocity` / `xwiki-commons-legacy-component` for aspects).

- **Whole type** (class / interface / enum): move the `.java` file verbatim into the legacy module
  under the same package (see `xwiki-commons-legacy-job` → `JobManager`). Nothing else needed beyond
  the module being a weaver (step 4) — a re-added top-level type does not even require an aspect.

- **Instance method / field on a concrete class**: add an AspectJ **inter-type declaration** in a
  `src/main/aspect/…/<Class>CompatibilityAspect.aj`, delegating to the replacement, e.g.

  ```java
  public privileged aspect JSONToolCompatibilityAspect
  {
      @Deprecated
      public Object JSONTool.parse(String json)
      {
          return fromString(json);
      }
  }
  ```

- **Interface method**: an ITD cannot add an abstract method to an interface's implementors, so use a
  companion interface carrying the method as a **default** method, plus a `declare parents` aspect
  that makes the woven interface extend it:

  ```java
  // CompatiblePropertyDescriptor.java  (plain source in the legacy module)
  public interface CompatiblePropertyDescriptor
  {
      @Deprecated
      default Field getFied()
      {
          return ((PropertyDescriptor) this).getField();   // delegate to the replacement
      }
  }

  // PropertyDescriptorCompatibilityAspect.aj
  public aspect PropertyDescriptorCompatibilityAspect
  {
      declare parents : PropertyDescriptor implements CompatiblePropertyDescriptor;
  }
  ```

  After weaving, `PropertyDescriptor extends CompatiblePropertyDescriptor`, so every implementation
  inherits the default `getFied()` — no per-class ITD required. (The older `-legacy-component` code
  predates default methods and instead pairs an abstract `Compatibility*` interface with a per-class
  ITD aspect; prefer the default-method form in new code.)

Give new legacy types/aspects `@since <next-version>RC1` (see xwiki-knowledge for the version
string) and keep the original `@deprecated since …` line.

## 4. Make the legacy module a weaver (if it wasn't already)

A legacy module that only **added** classes (no `<weaveDependency>`) becomes a **replacement** of the
main artifact the moment it must modify an existing type. Mirror `xwiki-commons-legacy-velocity`'s
`pom.xml`:

- Properties: `xwiki.extension.features = <groupId>:<main-artifactId>` and an `xwiki.extension.name`.
- Dependencies: the main module as `<type>pom</type>` (trigger, no jar) **and** again as
  `<scope>provided</scope>` (build order + weaving source); add `org.aspectj:aspectjrt`.
- `aspectj-maven-plugin` with a `<weaveDependency>` naming the main artifact.
- `maven-jar-plugin` excluding `**/builddef.lst`.
- `maven-surefire-plugin` `classpathDependencyExcludes` for the main jar (and
  `xwiki-commons-component-api` jar) so tests run against the woven jar only.
- If the main module ships a `META-INF/components.txt`, a `maven-antrun-plugin` step (phase
  `process-classes`) that **concats the legacy module's own `components.txt` onto the woven one**
  (`append="true"`). The woven jar must end up with *all* component lines (main + legacy). Verify:
  `wc -l target/classes/META-INF/components.txt` and check for no duplicates.
- If the module runs Spoon, set the `ComponentAnnotationProcessor` `skipForeignDeclarations=true`
  (the merged `components.txt` references classes that come from the woven dependency).

## 5. Add the Revapi ignore

Removing the API from the main module is a break Revapi will flag. Add a `<revapi.differences>` entry
under `<analysisConfiguration>` of the repo's core aggregator pom — commons:
`xwiki-commons-core/pom.xml`, platform: `xwiki-platform-core/pom.xml` — with `criticality` `allowed`
and a justification that the API moved to the legacy module, e.g.

```xml
<item>
  <ignore>true</ignore>
  <code>java.method.removed</code>
  <old>method java.lang.reflect.Field org.xwiki.properties.PropertyDescriptor::getFied()</old>
</item>
```

Use `java.class.removed` for a whole type, and `&lt;init&gt;` for a constructor:
`method void com.acme.store.Store::&lt;init&gt;(com.acme.Context)`.

**Enumerate the items from your own diff, not from the build** — for some modules the build reports
nothing at all (step 8), and a member unreported today breaks a downstream module tomorrow. Add the
interface *and* each impl when Revapi tracks them separately.

## 6. Fix the legacy module's coverage ratio

Once the legacy module weaves the whole main artifact, its jar now bundles the (untested-here) main
classes, so its JaCoCo instruction ratio drops sharply. Lower `xwiki.jacoco.instructionRatio` to the
new achieved value with a comment explaining the module re-exports the main artifact (as
`xwiki-commons-legacy-velocity` does). Use the `xwiki-increase-test-coverage` skill to compute it.

## 7. Ban the main artifact in the WAR (only when the module *became* a weaver in step 4)

A weaving legacy module's jar is a full *replacement* of the main jar, so packaging **both** in the
WAR under the `legacy` profile is a conflict (duplicate, woven-vs-clean classes). If step 4 turned a
previously non-weaving legacy module into a weaver — i.e. the main artifact was **not** banned before
— you must update
`xwiki-platform-distribution/xwiki-platform-distribution-war-legacydependencies/pom.xml` in the
**xwiki-platform** repo (released together with commons/rendering):

- **Ban** the main artifact in the `maven-enforcer-plugin` `bannedDependencies` rule:
  `<exclude>org.xwiki.commons:xwiki-commons-<name>:*:jar:*</exclude>` — this fails the build if the
  clean jar ever comes back, and
- **Exclude** the main artifact from the `xwiki-platform-distribution-war-dependencies` dependency
  (and from any other legacy dependency that pulls it in transitively — the enforcer tells you where).

Model it on the existing `xwiki-commons-velocity` / `xwiki-commons-component-*` entries, which are
wrapped commons modules handled exactly this way. (A legacy module that was *already* a weaver — and
thus already banned — needs nothing here.)

## 8. Build and verify

Build the main module **and** the legacy weaver with all checks — this is exactly the case the
`xwiki-build` skill covers ("also rebuild any legacy module that weaves the changed module"):

```bash
mvn clean install -B -ntp -Pquality,legacy \
  -pl <main-module-path>,<legacy-module-path>
```

`-Pquality` is mandatory: it runs Revapi **and** the JaCoCo check (confirms the lowered ratio). Then
sanity-check the outcome with `javap` on the woven legacy classes: the main jar must no longer expose
the API, and the legacy jar must re-add it.

**This build cannot validate your Revapi ignore, so never read its silence as "no ignore needed".** The
main module may skip Revapi (`grep revapi.skip <main-module>/pom.xml` — `xwiki-platform-oldcore` does),
and the legacy weaver is green by construction since its jar re-adds the API. The break only shows up on
a downstream consumer (the `backward-compatibility` OKF topic explains why), so verify there:

```bash
cd <a module depending on the main artifact> && mvn compile revapi:check -B -ntp -Pquality
```

Run it with **and** without your ignore (`git stash push -- <core-pom>`): failing without and passing
with is the only proof the `<old>` signature matches Revapi's own rendering.

Open the PR with the `xwiki-pull-request` conventions (`[Misc]` prefix when there is no JIRA issue).
